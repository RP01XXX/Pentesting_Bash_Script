# Pentesting_Bash_Script
These are my scripts used during a Pentest

1. Initial Recon
This is a quick scan for low hanging fruit during a pentest, it does my quick scans so I have some things to look at while my bigger scans can then run. Ideally it means I have things to do while waiting for scans to complete.
- A ping scan to find living hosts
- A full scan of those hosts
- A UDP scan
- Null Share Identification
- SMB Signing Status
- Hostname Enumeration
- Domain Name Enumeration
- Eyewitness webpage capture
- SSL Scan
